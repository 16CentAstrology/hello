# Security Policy

At PayPal, we take security very seriously. If you have found a security bug with PayPal, we ask that you follow the below process to share security bugs with us in a responsible way. This process allows us to review and resolve the issue and keep our customers safe while providing you public recognition for the submission.

## PayPal Bug Bounty Program

PayPal runs a bug bounty program that provides monetary awards for significant findings. If you have found a security bug, please visit the site and follow the submission process to responsibly report the bug to PayPal.

[https://www.paypal.com/bugbounty/](https://www.paypal.com/bugbounty/)

Quarterly, we recognize the top-10 security researchers who have had confirmed bug reports submitted through the program on our [PayPal Bug Bounty Wall of Fame](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/security-tools/wall-of-fame). We do this to publically recognize the researchers for the hard work they have done, and also to show them respect for responsibly reporting security bugs through the program.

Please read the [program terms for full details](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/security-tools/reporting-security-issues) about the submission process and eligibility for monetary awards.
